# TensorBoard setup on Amazon EKS 
This document explains how to setup TensorBoard on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Prerequisite
1. Create [EKS cluster using GPU](eks-gpu.md)

## Steps 
To set up TensorBoard one has to have event file of training available to see the visualization or summary of it. For completeness I have added a program (`tensorboard/tbdemo.py`) which performs addition and write the summary to event file. I have also added a Dockerfile (`tensorboard/Dockerfile`) which has tensorboard as well as event file generated by `tbdemo.py`. To complete the experiement a docker image (`rgaut/tensorboard`)has been publish. 

1. File `tensorboard/tensorboard_demo.yaml` creates a deployment which runs the tensorboard on event files. A service is also being created so that user can access tensorboard via browser
   ```
     kubectl create -f tensorboard/tensorboard_demo.py 
   ```
   
   
   Note: Some time you might have to do port-forwarding as well in case if you are under the firewall network by running below command. 
   ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/tensorboard 6006:6006
   ```

   Once the deployments and services are up goto your browser and type `127.0.0.1:6006` to access the tensorboard visusalization.
